Whether Watching or Cooking, The Times is all about reader service.

Eighty years ago, we were also in the business of Reuniting.

For 15 cents, a customer could purchase a small brass tag and attach it to a key ring.

“Lost articles returned through The New York Times,” the front of the tag said. “Lackawanna 1000.”

"For return drop in mail box,” the reverse said. “The New York Times Lost & Found Dept. Times Square, N.Y.”

Stamped on each of 4,500 tags was a unique number. A misplaced key ring with one of these tags could be dropped into a mail box by the finder. The Post Office would deliver it to The Times, which would in turn contact the rightful owner, who could then arrange with the newspaper for its return.

Several sets of keys were returned weekly, our house organ, The Little Times, reported in April 1931.

Most astonishing was the return in 1933 of keys belonging to Jay E. Sims of Kinston, N.C. He hadn’t simply mislaid them. He’d dropped them overboard from a fishing boat, in 14 feet of water off Boynton Beach, Fla.

“To his surprise and gratification, more than a month later, the keys were returned,” The Times said in a self-congratulatory advertisement. “How the keys came to light is a deep-sea mystery, but their return was due to the fact that Mr. Sims’s key ring bore a New York Times tag. The unknown finder mailed the keys to The New York Times and they were promptly returned to the owner.”
